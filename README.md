# Artemis
A toy language designed for self-educating purposes.

As I progress through ``A Practical Approach to Compiler Construction'' by 
Des Watson, I will add more code to this repository. It will probably start 
with mainly implementations of questions posed in the book. Later, the focus 
will shift to be on the development of the Artemis programming language.
